Specific conductance	Conductivity is a measure of water’s capability to pass electrical flow. This ability is directly related to the concentration of ions in the water. These conductive ions come from dissolved salts and inorganic materials such as alkalis, chlorides, sulfides and carbonate compounds 3. Compounds that dissolve into ions are also known as electrolytes 40. The more ions that are present, the higher the conductivity of water. 		
pH	 pH is a figure between 0 and 14 defining how acidic or basic a body of water is along a logarithmic scale. The lower the number, the more acidic the water is. The higher the number, the more basic it is. A pH of 7 is considered neutral. 	ph_levels.jpg	Fondriest Environmental, Inc. ‘pH of Water.’ Fundamentals of Environmental Measurements. 19 Nov. 2013.

Total dissolved solids	Total dissolved solids (TDS) combine the sum of all ion particles that are smaller than 2 microns (0.0002 cm). This includes all of the disassociated electrolytes that make up salinity concentrations, as well as other compounds such as dissolved organic matter. In “clean” water, TDS is approximately equal to salinity. In wastewater or polluted areas, TDS can include organic solutes (such as hydrocarbons and urea) in addition to the salt ions.	tds.jpg	Fondriest Environmental, Inc. ‘Conductivity, Salinity and Total Dissolved Solids.’ Fundamentals of Environmental Measurements. 3 Mar 2014.

Temperature, water	Temperature is an important factor to consider when assessing water quality. In addition to its own effects, temperature influences several other parameters and can alter the physical and chemical properties of water.

Dissolved oxygen (DO)	Dissolved oxygen refers to the level of free, non-compound oxygen present in water or other liquids. It is an important parameter in assessing water quality because of its influence on the organisms living within a body of water.	dissolvedoxygen_levels-fresh.jpg	Fondriest Environmental, Inc. ‘Dissolved Oxygen.’ Fundamentals of Environmental Measurements. 19 Nov. 2013.

Salinity	Salinity is an ambiguous term. As a basic definition, salinity is the total concentration of all dissolved salts in water. These electrolytes form ionic particles as they dissolve, each with a positive and negative charge. As such, salinity is a strong contributor to conductivity. While salinity can be measured by a complete chemical analysis, this method is difficult and time consuming.
